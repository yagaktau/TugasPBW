            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>S</strong>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-studded.
                They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, 
                enclosing white flowers, lobed foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There are over 600 assortments of Strawberries
                that vary in taste, size, and feel. All of which have similiar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow 
                seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk that embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is
                picture of the strawberry fruit.

            <h2>Detailed history</h2>
            <p>
                The word strawberry is coined from "strewn" berries about plants and thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into 
                "Strawberry" (Roger). They are not actual fruits or berries, but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. The seeds 
                are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There are around 200 seeds for 
                each berry. They are low in calories and are non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B5, and potassium (Roger).

            <p>
                Over the years, they have been utilized as medications for ailments like, stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9).
                Strawberries were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, and excellence. The most well-known communal 
                intake of strawberries is at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very well attired Englishmen in the 
                middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).
